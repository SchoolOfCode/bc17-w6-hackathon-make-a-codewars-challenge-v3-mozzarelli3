# Breaking the Code - Bonus Kata

So you think you're up to the challenge? You really think that you can crack the secret password? Okay then, let's get started...

In order to break into the secret vault, you need the password. To get this password, you must unscramble this code: 

9  12-15-22-5  20-1-3-15-19

We don't know what it means but that's your job! We want you, Special Agent #1 to crack that code!




### Plan

Initial rough plan:
- Write a secret password in the code
- For each letter used, assign a another letter
- Player has to create a function to unscramble code?
