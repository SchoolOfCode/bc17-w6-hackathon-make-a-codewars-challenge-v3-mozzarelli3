# Mozzarelli3's Katas

There are two katas here:

- Kata 1
    - This is the main kata and involves converting an uppercase string into a lowercase one.

- Bonus Kata
    - This is a bonus kata that I started and have tried to solve but failed within the time slot. I wanted to include it here so I asked ChatGPT to check whether the test works in time for the presentations, so it may work or may not ðŸ˜‚. Try at your own risk. 
    - It involves breaking a code. Each letter in the alphabet corresponds to a number (a = 1, b = 2, etc.). The task is to uncode a secret phrase.


I have included solutions to both katas (the bonus kata is ChatGPT generated) in ../Info/SOLUTIONS.md

As there are two katas, there may be some confusion when running the tests.
If you've successfully done the first kata, then the test should show 1 passed test file and 1 failed test file. This is correct, as the failed test file is for the second kata. Sorry for the confusion! Wasn't sure how to fix this.


### Set up

You may need to do the following to set up the repo on your device:

1. Install npm using `npm install`
2. Install vitest as dev dependency `npm install -D vitest`
3. Create script = `"start-test": "vitest"`
4. To run test, use `npm run start-test` in the terminal


Good luck! ðŸ˜Š
