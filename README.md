# Mozzarelli3's Katas

There are two katas here:

- Kata 1
    - This is the main kata and involves converting an uppercase string into a lowercase one.

- Bonus Kata
    - This is a bonus kata that I have made and have tried to solve but failed within the time slot. I asked ChatGPT to fix the test in time for the presentations, so it may work or may not ðŸ˜‚. Try at your own risk. 
    - It involves breaking a code. Each letter in the alphabet corresponds to a number (a = 1, b = 2, etc.). The task it to uncode a secret phrase.


I have included solutions to both katas (the bonus kata is ChatGPT generated) in ../Info/SOLUTIONS.md
