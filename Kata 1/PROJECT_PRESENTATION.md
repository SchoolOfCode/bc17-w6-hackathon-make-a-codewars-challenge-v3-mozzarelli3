# Make It Lowercase!

Here at FancyFontHQ, we pride outselves on the quality of our font. One of our interns is struggling to make the phrase "I LOVE TACOS" completely lowercase. Do you think you can help them?

The task for you is to take the string above and convert it to become "i love tacos". Easy right? Give it a go under main.test.js!

## Presentation

#### Hello! 

Purpose - The goal of this project is to create a function, makeLowerCase, that converts any given string to lowercase. 

#### Key Objectives:
- Implement a simple and reusable JavaScript function.
- Ensure the function handles various edge cases.
- Validate the function with thorough testing.

#### Planning Steps
1. Define the Function: Write the function signature and include the logic to convert the string to lowercase.
2. Write Tests: Create test cases that cover typical scenarios, including edge cases.
3. Document the Process: Plan to document each step, from brainstorming to the final implementation, in a markdown file.   
.

#### If I had more time:
- I would have liked to write test that handles an error, such as inputting the wrong string, etc.
- I would have also liked to have finished the bonus Kata and not use ChatGPT to finish the last bit so others could try it.

#### Reflections
- I really enjoyed this hackathon.
- Worked well with my teammate, Carmen, to brainstorm ideas and chat about our katas.
- I think next time narrowing down my options and creating more realistic ideas would be good. I got carried away with creating a bigger and more complex kata that I ran out of time.
